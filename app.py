# --- V6 UPGRADE: CONVERSATIONAL MEMORY AND VASTLY EXPANDED RESPONSE LIBRARY ---

RESPONSE_LIBRARY = {
    "stress": [
        "It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. The Gita teaches that much of our stress comes from attachment to results we can't control. Let's practice letting go. First, ground yourself with a simple exercise: name three things you can see right now. This brings you to the present, the only place you have power.",
        "Anxiety often pulls us into a future that hasn't happened. The Gita advises us to focus on our present action (dharma). Let's try a calming breath: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, and exhale for 6. By focusing on your breath, you anchor yourself in the now, freeing your mind from 'what if'.",
        "When feeling overwhelmed, remember Krishna's advice to Arjuna: 'Perform your duty and leave the results to me.' This means focusing only on the next small step, not the entire journey. What is one tiny action you can take right now, without worrying about the outcome?",
        "That feeling of being burnt out is a signal to pause. The Gita doesn't advocate for constant action, but for *wise* action. True rest is a vital part of your dharma. Can you give yourself permission to do one small, restorative thing in the next hour, like listening to a calm song or sitting in silence for five minutes?",
        "Worry is like a rocking chair; it gives you something to do but gets you nowhere. The Gita teaches us to act with 'equanimity'‚Äîa balanced mind. Let's try to observe your anxious thoughts without getting caught in them. Imagine them as clouds passing in the sky. You are the sky, not the clouds.",
        "Panic can feel like a storm inside. The Gita says the wise person is like the ocean, which remains calm even as rivers flow into it. Let's find your inner ocean. Place your feet firmly on the ground. Feel the solid earth beneath you. You are supported. Breathe into that feeling of stability.",
        "Stress often arises when we feel our situation is permanent. The Gita reminds us that everything is in a state of flux. This difficult moment will pass, just as day follows night. A practical step is to do something different for just five minutes to break the cycle. Can you walk to a different room or look out a window?",
    ],
    "sadness": [
        "I'm truly sorry you're feeling this way. Please be gentle with yourself. The Gita reminds us that feelings, like seasons, are temporary (Chapter 2, Verse 14). This pain is not permanent. A simple act of self-kindness can be a powerful anchor. Can you place a hand on your heart and just acknowledge, 'This is hard,' offering yourself a moment of grace?",
        "Feeling hopeless is incredibly difficult, but the Gita teaches that your true Self (Atman) is a source of eternal strength, untouched by these feelings. You are more resilient than you know. Let's find one tiny spark: what is one small thing, no matter how simple, that you could do for yourself in the next hour?",
        "Loneliness can feel vast and empty. The Gita teaches that the divine consciousness resides within all beings. You are fundamentally connected to everything. A practical way to feel this is to connect with nature. Can you look out a window and notice the details of a single leaf or a cloud? This can remind us we are part of a larger whole.",
        "When you feel low, your mind might tell you harsh stories about yourself. The Gita asks us to be a witness to our thoughts, not to believe every one of them. You are the sky, and your thoughts are just clouds. Let's try to observe one sad thought without judgment, just letting it float by.",
        "Grief is a testament to love. The Gita teaches that the soul is eternal and cannot be destroyed. While the physical form is gone, the essence remains. Allow yourself to feel this sorrow without judgment. It is a sacred part of your connection. What is one cherished memory you can hold in your heart right now?",
    ],
    "motivation": [
        "Motivation often follows action, not the other way around. The Gita champions 'Karma Yoga'‚Äîthe power of action without fear of the outcome. Let's make the first step incredibly small. Can you commit to just two minutes of a task? The goal isn't to finish, but simply to begin.",
        "Feeling overwhelmed by a goal is natural. The Gita advises us to focus on the action, not the fruit of the action. Don't look at the whole staircase; just focus on the first step. What is the absolute smallest action you can take right now to move forward?",
        "The fear of failure can be paralyzing. Krishna reminds Arjuna that both success and failure should be met with equanimity. The real victory is in doing your duty with a pure heart. What would you do if you knew you could not fail? Let's explore that.",
        "Fear of change is fear of the unknown. The Gita teaches that change is the only constant in the material world: 'The soul is not born, nor does it die.' (Chapter 2, Verse 20). While circumstances change, your true Self is stable. Let's focus on that inner anchor. What is one thing about you that remains true, no matter what changes around you?",
        "Self-doubt is the mind questioning your true nature. The Gita affirms that the divine Self (Atman) within you is perfect and whole. Let's challenge that doubt with a small piece of evidence. What is one thing, however small, that you have accomplished in the past week? Acknowledge that success.",
    ],
    "anger": [
        "Anger can be a powerful and overwhelming emotion. The Gita describes anger as arising from unfulfilled desire (Chapter 2, Verse 62). Before reacting, let's pause and understand. What desire or expectation might be underneath this anger?",
        "It's okay to feel angry. The wisdom lies not in suppressing it, but in how we respond. The Gita advises against acting impulsively. Let's try a 'wise response' exercise: take three deep breaths. Now, what is the most compassionate and constructive way you could respond to this situation, both for yourself and others?",
        "Frustration often comes from feeling powerless. Let's reclaim your power by focusing on what you can control. The Gita teaches that we control our actions, but not the results. What is one small, constructive action you can take right now, regardless of how others might react?",
        "Anger, as the Gita warns, clouds judgment and leads to delusion. Let's create some space between the feeling and your reaction. A simple physical action can help. Can you press your palms together firmly for ten seconds, then release? This can help discharge some of that intense energy safely.",
    ],
    "clarification": [
        "Thank you for sharing that. Sometimes feelings are hard to name. Does it feel more like a heaviness, like sadness, or more like a buzzing, like anxiety?",
        "I understand. Past thoughts can certainly weigh on us. Are these thoughts making you feel more worried about the future, or more sad about what has been?",
        "Let's try to explore this gently. When these thoughts or feelings arise, what physical sensations do you notice in your body? For example, a tightness in your chest or a knot in your stomach?",
        "That makes sense. Sometimes the feeling is just a general sense of unease. To help me understand, is this feeling more directed outward, like frustration with the world, or inward, like disappointment in yourself?"
    ],
    "encouragement": [
        "I'm with you. Go on.",
        "Take your time. I'm listening.",
        "Tell me more when you're ready.",
        "I'm here to hold space for that.",
        "Okay, I'm following."
    ],
    "repetition": [
        "I notice you've shared that a few times. It seems to be weighing very heavily on you. There's no pressure to talk more about it if you don't want to. I can just sit here with you in silence.",
        "It's okay if words are difficult right now. You've told me what's on your mind, and I've heard you. We don't have to analyze it. Would you prefer to try a simple breathing exercise instead, or just take a moment of quiet?",
        "I hear you. It seems like you're really in this feeling, and I want to honor that. Sometimes, just saying the word is enough. We can pause here if you'd like."
